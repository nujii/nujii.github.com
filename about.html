            <h3>Cameron Bytheway - Programming</h3>
            <p class="copy">
                The Code Monkey, as he is sometimes known, is the chief creator of Nujii Studio and
                a CS student at BYU. He is also the dude who spends hours a day making sure Nujii
                Studio is the coolest DAW you have ever used. Born and raised in Sandy, UT, he is
                the son of a super genius audio electrical engineer guy. This is the guy you want
                building your DAW. He also loves jazz and plays a mean set of drums, if you know
                what I mean.
            </p>
            <h3>Scott Wall - Business/Marketing</h3>
            <p class="copy">
                Scott “The Suit” Wall is the guy who handles the business side of things. However,
                when he’s not trying to build Nujii Studio, he jams to blues on his fender
                strat. As a Marketing student at BYU, he loves this sort of thing; so don’t feel bad for
                him even though his job is the lamest, cuz he’s cool with it.
            </p>
            <h3>Eric Thayne - Design</h3>
            <p class="copy">
                Eric, the artistic one, makes sure Nujii Studio is easy to use and drop dead gorgeous.
                He studies graphic design at BYU. When not working or studying, he spends time stroking the ivories (playing piano) and promoting himself as a musician. In fact, if you got a minute, look him up on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/ericthaynemusic">YouTube</a>. You'll be in for a treat.
